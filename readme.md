# AwesomeWM

Configuration file for AwesomeWM and rofi, both dark themed.

The themes folder refers only to AwesomeWM, to install it, copy the theme.lua file from the '/themes/Dark' folder to '/usr/share/awesome/'.

The rofi dark theme is my modification of the theme created by Rasi, to install you must copy the file 'android_notification.rasi' from the '/rofi/themes/' folder to '/usr/share/rofi/themes'.
