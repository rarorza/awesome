# AwesomeWM

Config files for AwesomeWM with widgets (battery, power menu, bluetooth menu and wifi menu), Rofi, Picom, Ranger, Alacritty and Zsh.

You can try my [script](https://github.com/rarorza/script) for post install Arch Linux or drop the files manually.

The ```/dotfiles/``` folder contains the AwesomeWM and Rofi themes, to install it, copy the ```theme.lua``` file from the ```/awesome/themes/Dark/``` to ```/usr/share/awesome/themes/Dark/``` and the file ```android_notification.rasi``` from ```/rofi/themes/``` to ```/usr/share/rofi/themes/```.

Use the command ```rofi-theme-selector```for select ```android_notification.rasi``` theme.
