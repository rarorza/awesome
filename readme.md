# AwesomeWM

Config files for AwesomeWM with widgets (battery, power menu, bluetooth menu and wifi menu), picom, ranger, alacritty and zsh.

You can try my [script](https://github.com/rarorza/script) for post install Arch Linux or drop the files manually.

The themes folder refers only to AwesomeWM, to install it, copy the theme.lua file from the '/themes/Dark' folder to '/usr/share/awesome/'.

The rofi dark theme is my modification of the Android Notification theme, to install you must copy the file 'android_notification.rasi' from the '/themes/' folder to '/usr/share/rofi/'.
